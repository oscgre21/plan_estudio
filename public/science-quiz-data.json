The Sun is a huge star that gives light and heat to all the planets.</p><p>The planets are divided into two groups: the inner planets and the outer planets. The inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They are smaller and made mostly of rock. Earth is the only planet known to have life.</p><p>The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are much larger and are made mostly of gas. Jupiter is the biggest planet in our Solar System, and Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings.</p><p>All the planets travel around the Sun in paths called orbits. The time each planet takes to go around the Sun is called a year. For example, Earth takes 365 days to make one orbit.</p>"
