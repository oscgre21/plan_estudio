EXTREME SPORTS AND ARCHAEOLOGY

EXTREME SPORTS

Extreme sports are exciting and dangerous activities that require special skills and equipment. Let's learn about some popular extreme sports:

KITE SURFING
Kite surfing is an extreme water sport that combines surfing with flying a large kite to move across the water. The kite catches the wind and pulls the surfer along the waves. It requires good balance, strong arms, and the ability to control the kite in different wind conditions.

MOTOCROSS
Motocross is an extreme sport where riders race motorcycles on rough outdoor tracks with jumps and obstacles. Riders need to have excellent motorcycle control and physical strength to handle the bumpy terrain. Motocross tracks often include hills, mud, and challenging turns.

SKIING
Skiing is a winter sport that involves sliding down snowy mountains on skis. There are different types of skiing including alpine skiing (downhill), cross-country skiing, and ski jumping. Skiers use poles to help them balance and turn. Skiing has been part of the Olympics since 1936.

SKATEBOARDING
Skateboarding is a sport that involves performing tricks and riding on a board with wheels. Skateboards were invented in California in the 1950s. Skateboarders can perform jumps, spins, and other impressive tricks in skateparks or on streets. Skateboarding has been a favorite sport for many years.

HANG-GLIDING
Hang-gliding is an extreme sport that involves flying through the air using a lightweight glider that you hang from. The pilot runs down a hill or jumps from a high place and the glider catches the wind, allowing them to soar like a bird. Hang-gliding requires courage and understanding of wind patterns.

SURFING
Surfing is a water sport where you ride ocean waves on a surfboard. Surfers paddle out into the ocean, wait for a good wave, then stand up on their board and ride the wave back to shore. Surfing requires good balance, swimming ability, and patience to wait for the right waves.

GRAMMAR: FOR AND SINCE

We use "for" with periods of time and "since" with specific points in time.

Examples with FOR (periods of time):
- Skateboarding has been my favorite sport for six months.
- Kitesurfing has been popular for twenty years.

Examples with SINCE (specific points in time):
- Snowboarding has been popular since the 1980s.
- Skiing has been part of the Olympics since 1936.
- Since the 1930s, millions of people have tried skiing.

ADVERBS OF EMPHASIS

Adverbs of emphasis like "super", "really", "so", "extremely", "incredibly", and "very" come BEFORE adjectives.

Correct examples:
- Extreme skiing can be super dangerous.
- Our kayaking trip was so amazing.
- The mountain bike riders are incredibly careful.
- He was extremely lucky he did not get injured.
- Skiing is very fun on a sunny day.

ARCHAEOLOGY

Archaeology is the study of human history through excavation and analysis of artifacts and other physical remains. Let's learn important archaeology vocabulary:

SITE
A site is a place that archaeologists want to excavate or explore. Archaeological sites can be ancient cities, burial grounds, or places where people lived long ago. Sites contain clues about how people lived in the past.

ARTIFACTS
Artifacts are objects found at the site. They are not living things. They were made by someone in the past. Artifacts can include pottery, tools, weapons, jewelry, and other human-made objects. These artifacts help archaeologists understand past civilizations.

EXCAVATE
To excavate means to uncover something by removing the soil or earth that is covering it. Archaeologists carefully excavate sites to find and preserve artifacts without damaging them.

ANALYZE
To analyze means to study something closely and carefully to understand it better. Archaeologists analyze artifacts to learn about the people who made and used them.

BURY
To bury means to put a dead person or animal in the ground or in a tomb. Many ancient cultures buried their dead with artifacts and treasures.

DISCOVER
To discover means to see or find something for the first time, to learn about something new. Archaeologists discover new sites and artifacts that teach us about history.

DIE
To die means to stop living, when a living being ceases to be alive.

DNA TEST
A DNA test is a way to discover what is in the body's cells. It can help you find your relatives by analyzing genetic material. Archaeologists use DNA tests on ancient remains to learn about family relationships and migrations of ancient peoples.

CT SCAN
A CT scan (computed tomography scan) is a way to see inside a body. You can discover if a person has illnesses. Archaeologists use CT scans to study mummies and ancient remains without damaging them.

SAMPLE
A sample is a small amount of something, such as food or bone, that someone analyzes. Archaeologists take samples from sites to study in laboratories.

PASSIVE VOICE IN ARCHAEOLOGY

The passive voice is often used in archaeology to describe historical events.

Examples:
- The Sphinx was built in Egypt a very long time ago.
- The people of Pompeii were buried under a volcano.
- Gold treasures were found in England.
- The treasures weren't hidden in a tomb.

FAMOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES

The Sphinx: The Sphinx was built in Egypt thousands of years ago. It has the body of a lion and the head of a human.

Pompeii: The people of Pompeii were buried under volcanic ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. Their city was preserved and gives us amazing insights into Roman life.

Gold Treasures: Many gold treasures have been found in England and other countries, showing the wealth and craftsmanship of ancient civilizations.
