You are an expert educational content creator. Based on the following study material, generate a definition-matching quiz in JSON format.

STUDY MATERIAL:
{DOCUMENT_TEXT}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract 10-20 key concepts/terms from the material
2. For each term, create a definition-based question
3. Provide 4 word options with emojis (one correct, three plausible distractors)
4. Use clear, educational definitions
5. Choose appropriate emojis for each word option

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES:
- Use ONLY double quotes for strings
- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON array
- Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no comments
- Audio filenames pattern: "audios/question-{word}.mp3"

JSON STRUCTURE:
Return a JSON array where each element follows this format:

{
  "question": "This is a [definition of the concept].",
  "audioQuestion": "audios/question-word.mp3",
  "correctAnswer": "CORRECT WORD",
  "options": [
    {
      "word": "CORRECT WORD",
      "emoji": "✅",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "word": "DISTRACTOR 1",
      "emoji": "❌",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "word": "DISTRACTOR 2",
      "emoji": "🔴",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "word": "DISTRACTOR 3",
      "isCorrect": false
    }
  ]
}

GUIDELINES:
- Definitions should be clear and educational (not just dictionary style)
- Pattern: "This is a/an [description that clearly identifies the concept]"
- Distractors should be related terms that could plausibly fit but are incorrect
- Not all options need emojis (optional for distractors)
- All words should be UPPERCASE
- Make sure correctAnswer exactly matches the correct option's word

EXAMPLE:
{
  "question": "This is a large celestial body that orbits around a star.",
  "audioQuestion": "audios/question-planet.mp3",
  "correctAnswer": "PLANET",
  "options": [
    {
      "word": "PLANET",
      "emoji": "🪐",
      "isCorrect": true
    },
    {
      "word": "ORBIT",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "word": "STAR",
      "emoji": "⭐",
      "isCorrect": false
    },
    {
      "word": "MOON",
      "emoji": "🌙",
      "isCorrect": false
    }
  ]
}
